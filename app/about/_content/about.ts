      "My journey into the world of programming began when I was just 12 years old through my older brother, who at the time was studying Computer Science for his GCSE's. I grew up in a family where everything is a competition, and I was adamant that I could create a better game than him. Little did I know that this initial spark of ambition would evolve into a passion for creating applications, games, and even venturing into the realm of robotics.",
      "I've recently graduated with a BEng in Computer Systems Engineering (A blend of computer science and electronics) from The University of Bath. I had the opportunity to work full-time as a full stack developer at an exciting startup through my placement year. Working closely with the founder, CTO and senior developers was an invaluable experience that enriched me with a wealth of knowledge and practical skills.",
      "Subsequently, during my final year, I embarked on a part-time internship as an Investment Analyst at Europe's leading pre-seed investment fund for university startups. This unique opportunity allowed me to explore the business side of the startup world. The knowledge I acquired during this time has propelled me forward on my path to becoming a well-rounded programmer with a keen understanding of business dynamics.",
      "Currently, I am actively seeking a new employment opportunity that will enable me to continue my career in software development.",

Together, we've accomplished various projects, including designing network topologies for businesses, handling mains electrical connections for both residential and commercial properties, constructing durable driveways for heavy usage, tiling and insulating roofs, and even crafting sturdy brick sheds, among many other achievements.",
